[00:30.40] Sometimes I wish you knew
[00:33.45] But I disguise the truth
[00:36.76] I say I'm happy but I'm still stuck on us, mm-mm-mm
[00:42.21] Does your mind play this game too?
[00:45.88] Think 'bout me and you
[00:48.38] I guess I'll just pretend, until it all makes sense
[00:51.90] Hm-mm-hm, hmm-hmm
[01:00.40] 
[00:54.82] See you face to face, I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be
[01:00.31] But I can't make a scene, but I can't make a scene
[01:06.63] See you face to face, I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be
[01:12.19] But I can't make a scene, but I can't make a scene
[01:37.19] 
[01:17.06] Like I want you
[01:22.02] You, ooh, ooh
[01:26.73] Even if it's true, ooh
[01:30.85] Ooh-ooh-ooh
[01:36.10] Even if it's true
[01:44.60] 
[01:43.11] I guess it's overdue
[01:45.54] Tell me your point of view
[01:48.60] Tell me am I to blame?
[01:50.44] You're so good with change, hm-hm-mm
[01:54.32] A table set for two
[01:57.27] You got me waitin' but you ain't comin' through
[01:59.71] Try to stay patient but gotta face the truth, mm-mm-mm
[02:03.63] Oh, woah-woah
[02:10.13] 
[02:06.43] See you face to face (see you face to face)
[02:08.14] I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be (I'm thinking 'bout the days)
[02:12.12] But I can't make a scene (no, I can't make a scene)
[02:15.15] But I can't make a scene (no, no, no, no, oh)
[02:19.19] See you face to face (see you face)
[02:19.80] I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be (oh-oh)
[02:24.59] But I can't make a scene (no, no-no, no-no)
[02:27.69] But I can't make a scene
[02:39.69] 
[02:29.36] Like I want you
[02:33.24] You, ooh, ooh
[02:39.19] Even if it's true, ooh (even if it's true)
[02:42.45] Ooh-ooh-ooh (you, babe)
[02:47.51] Even if it's true
[02:56.01] 
[02:54.59] There's no reason to believe I'll save us now
[02:58.16] But if you really love me say it now
[03:00.83] Why is it so hard to figure out?
[03:03.62] I need you every day, believe me when I say it
[03:26.62] 
[03:16.74] Like I want you
[03:20.78] You, ooh, ooh
[03:27.25] Even if it's true, ooh
[03:30.49] Ooh-ooh-ooh
[03:35.64] Even if it's true
