Well I want you to want me baby

You got my heart on the end of your string
Like a yo-yo dancin’ you’re watchin’ it swing
I walk the dog go around the world
Anything you ask me to
But it’s high time you got serious honey
Stop treatin’ me like some little love junkie
You know you got your hold on me can’t nothin’ break me lose
But I want you to want me baby
Want me like I want you
Need you to need me baby

Love me like I love you

Want me like I want you

Well it's high time you got serious honey
Stop treatin’ me like some little love junkie
You know you've got your hold on me can’t nothin’ break me loose
I want you to want me baby
Want me like I want you
Need you to need me baby
Need me like I need you
Yeah I want you to love me baby
Love me like I love you
Want you to want me baby
Want me like I want you
Want you to want me like I want you
